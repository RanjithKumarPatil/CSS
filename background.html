    <h2>What is browser</h2>
    <p>
      Many people will use web browsers today for access to the internet and is
      seen almost as a necessity in how many navigate their daily life. A Web
      browser is a client program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
      to make requests of Web servers throughout the Internet on behalf of the
      browser user.

    <p>
      A browser is a client program as it runs on a user computer or mobile
      device and contacts the webserver for the information requested by the
      user. The web server sends the data back to the browser that displays the
      results on internet supported devices. On behalf of the users, the browser
      sends requests to web servers all over the internet by using HTTP
      (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). A browser requires a smartphone, computer,
      or tablet and internet to work.
